## AWS

The repo has direct AWS integrations for image distribution, deployment, DNS, and certificate issuance. `bin/ecr` pushes the container image to private ECR, `bin/ecs` creates or updates the ECS service and task definition, `bin/route53` creates the hosted zone and DNS records for the active ECS task, and `bin/cert` requests an ACM certificate, exports it for the container runtime, and refreshes ECS and Route 53 so HTTPS can come up end to end.

### `bin/ecr`

Pushes the local Docker build to private ECR. Fill in:

- `AWS_ECR_REGION`: the AWS region that owns the registry, such as `us-west-2`
- `AWS_ECR_ACCOUNT_ID`: the AWS account ID that owns the registry
- `AWS_ECR_REPOSITORY`: the ECR repository name, usually `symfonicat/core`

The helper uses these defaults unless you override them:

- `AWS_ECR_TAG=latest`
- `AWS_ECR_CONTEXT=.`
- `AWS_ECR_DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile`
- `AWS_ECR_BUILD_TARGET=runtime`
- `AWS_ECR_LOCAL_IMAGE=symfonicat-core-php:local`

### `bin/ecs`

Creates or updates the ECS cluster, task definition, and service. Fill in:

- `AWS_ECS_REGION`: the AWS region for ECS, such as `us-west-2`
- `AWS_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME`: the ECS cluster name, usually `symfonicat`
- `AWS_ECS_SERVICE_NAME`: the ECS service name, usually `symfonicat`
- `AWS_ECS_CONTAINER_NAME`: the container name inside the task, usually `symfonicat`
- `AWS_ECS_IMAGE_URI`: the full ECR image URI, such as `764416828667.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/symfonicat/core:latest`

The helper defaults the first-run ECS shape unless you override it:

- `AWS_ECS_TASK_FAMILY=symfonicat`
- `AWS_ECS_LAUNCH_TYPE=FARGATE`
- `AWS_ECS_CPU=512`
- `AWS_ECS_MEMORY=1024`
- `AWS_ECS_CONTAINER_PORT=443`
- `AWS_ECS_DESIRED_COUNT=1`
- `AWS_ECS_ASSIGN_PUBLIC_IP=ENABLED`
- `AWS_ECS_SUBNETS_JSON` can be left blank to auto-discover default VPC subnets
- `AWS_ECS_SECURITY_GROUPS_JSON` can be left blank to auto-create the service security group
- `AWS_ECS_TARGET_GROUP_ARN` can be left blank unless you already have a load balancer
- `AWS_ECS_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN` can be left blank to create or reuse `ecsTaskExecutionRole`
- `AWS_ECS_TASK_ROLE_ARN` can be left blank unless the app code needs AWS API access
- `AWS_ECS_WAIT_FOR_STABLE=1`

`bin/ecs` also loads `/.env.certificate.local` when present, so `AWS_ECS_TLS_FULLCHAIN_B64` and `AWS_ECS_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` can be carried into the task definition after `bin/cert` exports them.

### `bin/route53`

Creates the hosted zone for a domain and writes apex plus wildcard DNS records to the current ECS task IP. Fill in:

- `AWS_ECS_REGION`: the ECS region to inspect
- `AWS_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME`: the ECS cluster name
- `AWS_ECS_SERVICE_NAME`: the ECS service name
- `AWS_ECS_CONTAINER_NAME`: the container name to inspect

Optional DNS settings:

- `AWS_ROUTE53_REGION`: the Route 53 region, defaulting to the ECS region
- `AWS_ROUTE53_RECORDS_JSON`: extra DNS records to publish in addition to the apex and wildcard `A` records

The script takes one domain argument, creates or reuses the hosted zone, prints the nameservers to delegate, and upserts `@` and `*` `A` records to the public IPv4 of the running ECS task.

### `bin/cert`

Requests an exportable ACM certificate for a domain and its wildcard, publishes the validation records, exports the cert for Caddy, and then redeploys ECS. Fill in:

- `AWS_ECS_REGION`: the ECS region to inspect
- `AWS_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME`: the ECS cluster name
- `AWS_ECS_SERVICE_NAME`: the ECS service name
- `AWS_ECS_CONTAINER_NAME`: the container name inside the task
- `AWS_ECS_IMAGE_URI`: the ECR image URI to deploy with the refreshed cert material

Optional cert settings:

- `AWS_CERT_REGION`: the ACM region, defaulting to the ECS region, then the Route 53 region, then `us-east-1`

`bin/cert` writes `/.env.certificate.local` with `AWS_ECS_TLS_FULLCHAIN_B64` and `AWS_ECS_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`, then runs `bin/ecs` and `bin/route53` so the new cert is applied and DNS is refreshed.
